### Modal Content

Modal boxes allow the user to create an entry point to the site that highlights an action whether it be a donation or a sign-up form. The user will have the ability to take the action or continue to the site. What is unique about this feature is that we allow you to set how long the a single user will be cookied for once they see the modal box for the first time. If your action is urgent you can set this to 0 days and every time that user visits the site they will get the modal. If your action is less time sensitive, you can set it to add more days before they user sees the modal again.

In a modal setup you will have the ability to publish or un-publish simply by selecting a toggle at the top. You also have the ability to add a donation form with selected amounts just like you would have done it for the main donation page/section. We also allow for users to embed video code directly into the body section of the modal. (Pro-tip, be sure to toggle to Markdown for Rich Text if you are embedding code).

## Homepage

Rising Campaigns Homepages offer a ton of flexibility to add sections and design elements to your liking. With each section having several different component options, no site will look the same, and we can choose from over 400,000 different combinations.  In this section of knowledgebase, we will go over all the components that can make up a homepage and work. 

### Marquee

Your Marquee is the first thing most site visitors will see when they visit your website. It consists of a Headline, Deck, Featured Graphic, and typically a Signup Form or other call-to-action.

> **Tip:** Keep the text short here, so folks scroll through the rest of the site sections.

The Marquee is accessible from the Admin portal by clicking **Homepage** on the left-side navigation, then **Marquee**. To edit the Marquee, select the box as shown with the red square below.

Once you have selected Marquee you will get the content options, which look like the following:

From here, you will need to do the following:

1. Create the Marquee title text. This should be relatively short and can be campaign name or tagline.
2. Upload an image. Make sure that the image is at least 1800 x 1800 pixels for the best quality.
3. Create the Deck (or body) content of the Marquee. This text should also be brief but tell the user what you are trying to do. 
4. If you need to make changes to the embedded form, [contact Support](mailto:support@risingcampaigns.com) for help

Now that you have seen what the Admin Portal looks like here is an overview of where each content section for the Marquee is at:

## Supplemental

The Supplemental section is where you can expand on your campaign. This is a great section to expand on messaging, introduce your candidate, or tell your campaign's story.

The Supplemental section is accessible from the Admin Portal by clicking **Homepage** on the left-side navigation, then **Supplemental**. To edit the Supplemental, select the box as shown with the red square below.

From here, you should see a screen that looks like this.

You can edit the following:

1. Supplemental Headline- This should be short and what the website is really about.
2. Upload an image. This image should be at least 1800x1800 pixels for best results.
3. Insert Supplemental body text. This section can consist of short or long-form copy, depending on the complexity of the site mission.
4. If linking to a second page you will need to insert a button title image and path URL to the destination page.

Below is an overview of where each content section for the Supplemental section lives:

## Donations

If your organization accepts donations, we use an ActBlue and NGPVAN/EveryAction embeds to power our donation forms. We’ll simply need a link to your ActBlue/EA Form and to populate the donation amount in the Admin Portal. Here is an example of what a donation form looks like:

### **ActBlue**

ActBlue Donation requires the URL of the ActBlue form and matching donation amounts. Here is a sample of the front end and what you see in the Admin Portal:

  ![](/img/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-17-at-1.52.35-pm.png)

  ![](/img/uploads/content_manager-3-.png)

  The user will be taken to the ActBlue for to complete their donation but the amount the user selected will be pre-populated. 

### NGPVAN/EveryAction

NGPVAN/EveryAction donation requires the URL of the EveryAction form and matching donation amounts. Here is a sample of the front end and what you see on the backend:

  ![](/img/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-17-at-1.52.35-pm.png)

  ![](/img/uploads/content_manager-2-.png)

The user will be taken to the NGPVAN/EveryAction for to complete their donation but the amount the user selected will be pre-populated. Through this integration we can also turn on form pre-fill if your users are cookied into NGPVAN/EveryAction Fast Pass system. 

## Forms

Rising Campaigns integrates with a variety of Commercial and Progressive Contact Relationship Managers (CRMs) such as MailChimp, The Action Network, and NGPVAN/EveryAction. Embeddable form code can be found where your organization creates them in the CRM. Once you have that code, simple place that code in the Body section of any page and your styled form will be created.

## Promotional Kickers

Promotion kickers allow you to place blocks of content that take the user to a new page whether it is information or action related is up to you. Kickers are a nice way to drive important action. Promotional Kickers are accessible from the Admin Portal by clicking **Homepage** on the left-side navigation, then **Promotion kickers**. To add or edit Promotion kickers, select the box as shown with the red square below.

### Modal Content

Modal boxes allow the user to create an entry point to the site that highlights an action whether it be a donation or a sign-up form. The user will have the ability to take the action or continue to the site. What is unique about this feature is that we allow you to set how long the a single user will be cookied for once they see the modal box for the first time. If your action is urgent you can set this to 0 days and every time that user visits the site they will get the modal. If your action is less time sensitive, you can set it to add more days before they user sees the modal again. 

In a modal setup you will have the ability to publish or un-publish simply by selecting a toggle at the top. You also have the ability to add a donation form with selected amounts just like you would have done it for the main donation page/section. We also allow for users to embed video code directly into the body section of the modal. (Pro-tip, be sure to toggle to Markdown for Rich Text if you are embedding code).

## Homepage

Rising Campaigns Homepages offer a ton of flexibility to add sections and design elements to your liking. With each section having several different component options no site will look the same and we have the ability to choose from over 400,000 different combinations.  In this section of knowledgebase we will go over all the components that can make up a homepage and how they work. 


### Marquee

Your marquee is the first thing site visitors will see . This is where you will drop intro text and an image. The image should be atleast 1800x1800 pixels. Tip- Keep the text short here so folks scroll through the rest of the site sections.  Here is a sample of a Marquee:


To get here in the backend, you login to the admin portal and you should see this screen. When you do on the left, Homepage will automatically be selected and you will be given the homepage section options. To edit the Marquee, select the box as shown with the red square below.  

Once you have selected Marquee you will get the content options, which look like the following:

    From here, you will need to do the following:



1. Create Marquee title text. This should be relatively short and can be campaign name or tagline.
2. Upload an image. Make sure that image is at least 1800 x 1800 pixels for the best quality. 
3. Create body content of the Marquee. This text should also be brief but tell the user what you are trying to do. Within the section you can add or edit form code embeds from supported partners (MailChimp, EveryAction/NGPVAN/ActionNetwork). If major changes need to take place to the form code and you are not familiar with Markdown, it’s best to email support@risingcampaigns to get help. 

Now that you have seen what the backend looks like here is an overview of where each content section for the marquee is at:

##  Supplemental

The supplemental section is a place where you tell as much as you can about your campaigns and function as possible. This is where your mission statement should and important details users are searching to learn about you should live. 


To get to the Supplemental content section, you login to the admin portal and you should see this screen. When you do on the left Homepage will automatically be selected and you will be given the homepage section options. To edit the Supplemental, select the box as shown with the red square below. 

From here, you should see a screen that looks like this. 

You will need to fill out the following:



1. Supplemental Headline- This should be short and what the website is really about.
2. Upload an image. This image should be at least 1800x1800 pixels for best results.
3. Insert Supplemental body text. This section can be longer or it can be brief and link to a longer form page depending on the complexity of the site mission.  
4. If linking a longer format page you will need to insert a button title image and path URL to the button destination. This destination can be to any style of page that lives on the site.  For more on page options, click here. 

Now that you know what the Supplemental section looks like on the backend here is an overview of the page aligned with the backend content. 

## Donations

What is it for? Answer: If your organization accepts donations, we use an ActBlue embed to power our donation forms. We’ll simply need a link to your ActBlue Form and to populate the donation amount on the backend. Here is an example of what that looks like.

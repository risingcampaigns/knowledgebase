## Homepage

Rising Campaigns Homepages offer a ton of flexibility to add sections and design elements to your liking. With each section having several different component options, no site will look the same, and we can choose from over 400,000 different combinations.  In this section of knowledgebase, we will go over all the components that can make up a homepage and work. 

### [Marquee](https://docs.risingcampaigns.com/articles/editing-the-marquee/)

Your Marquee is the first thing most site visitors will see when they visit your website. It consists of a Headline, Deck, Featured Graphic, and typically a Signup Form or other call-to-action.

### Supplemental

The Supplemental section is where you can expand on your campaign. This is a great section to expand on messaging, introduce your candidate, or tell your campaign's story.

### Donations

If your organization accepts donations, we use an ActBlue and NGPVAN/EveryAction embeds to power our donation forms. We’ll simply need a link to your ActBlue/EA Form and to populate the donation amount in the Admin Portal. Here is an example of what a donation form looks like:

#### [ActBlue](/articles/editing-donation-on-the-homepage/#actblue)


#### [NGPVAN EveryAction](/articles/editing-donation-on-the-homepage/#ngpvan-everyaction)

## Forms

Rising Campaigns integrates with a variety of Commercial and Progressive Contact Relationship Managers (CRMs) such as MailChimp, The Action Network, and NGPVAN/EveryAction. Embeddable form code can be found where your organization creates them in the CRM. Once you have that code, simple place that code in the Body section of any page and your styled form will be created.

## Promotional Kickers

Promotion kickers allow you to place blocks of content that take the user to a new page whether it is information or action related is up to you. Kickers are a nice way to drive important action. Promotional Kickers are accessible from the Admin Portal by clicking **Homepage** on the left-side navigation, then **Promotion kickers**. To add or edit Promotion kickers, select the box as shown with the red square below.

What will you need to for a promotional kicker?

* Title (Keep it short)
* Deck (Keep it short)
* Image (Optional)
* Link (This can be internal or external link)

Here is a sample Promotional Kicker section:

### Modal Content

Modal boxes allow the user to create an entry point to the site that highlights an action whether it be a donation or a sign-up form. The user will have the ability to take the action or continue to the site. What is unique about this feature is that we allow you to set how long the a single user will be cookied for once they see the modal box for the first time. If your action is urgent you can set this to 0 days and every time that user visits the site they will get the modal. If your action is less time sensitive, you can set it to add more days before they user sees the modal again. 

In a modal setup you will have the ability to publish or un-publish simply by selecting a toggle at the top. You also have the ability to add a donation form with selected amounts just like you would have done it for the main donation page/section. We also allow for users to embed video code directly into the body section of the modal. (Pro-tip, be sure to toggle to Markdown for Rich Text if you are embedding code).

5. Once you have selected the drop down you will have the option to re-order the content any way you want including to hide the content entirely. 

(Of note, the content order is everything after the Marquee. The Marquee will always start the page followed by the number ordered content blocks.)

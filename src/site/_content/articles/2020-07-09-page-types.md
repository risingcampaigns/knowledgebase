## Page Types

You can create a variety of different Page types in the Rising Campaigns platform. Any content block that requires its own URL and is not categorized by publish date can be considered a page. This includes basic content like Privacy Policies, organized content like your campaign's issues or platform, and more complex structured content including robust About Us pages with a mix of long form text and hierarchical components. In this section we will review all of the above.

**Standard functions of pages with body components:**

### Adding a Deck

Adding deck text is important to do for each article and page because it is text that search engines use when populating articles within search terms. By being diligent about adding in deck text for your Blog/News articles you will ensure more traffic based on the topic and will improve your overall SEO. 

### Using Rich Text Editor in Body

The Rich Text Editor allows you to add different types of text from **Bold** and *Italic* to different sizes of heading for your Body paragraph. The Rich Text Editor also allows for implementing bullets and numbered lists in addition to being able to add a code block and a block quote section. Finally by hitting the plus button you be able to add images to your post within the body block of the page.

2. Once you have toggled over to Markdown you can now paste the code in and hit publish. 

3. Wait roughly 1 minute and refresh the live version of the site to check and make sure the HTML snippet is displaying properly. If you paste in a video and the viewport is not responding properly, submit a ticket at help@risingcampaigns.com 



### Embed Pages

Embed Pages are the most complex pages of the page types. These pages have the ability to have the standard features of a deck, image, and body but can also host promotional kickers specific to that page title to push actions and it can also provide the ability to have groups. The groups function allows for the content creator to provide endorsements, staff bios, or individual information on elected officials. There are a number of ways that groups can be used but this option provides flexibility to display this content on specific pages within the website. 

The CMS will look like this for a Embed page:

and appear this way on the frontend:

### Basic Pages

Basic Pages are the simplest form of a page setup and comes with a title, deck, and body. Typically these pages are used for the Privacy Policy but can also be used as a page that just holds text.

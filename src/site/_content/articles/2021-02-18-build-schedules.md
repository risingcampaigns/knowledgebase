Our schedules are flexible and based on receiving materials from your Local to get started. Below is what you can expect from Discovery Call to Launch if all the scheduled dates are met with the content and approval. Some sites may go faster and some will certainly go slower, but this is what we will setup for. 

**Kick-off: Discovery Call**

* Website Primary Goal
* Secondary Goal
* Platform/Campaigns/Issues
* How frequently will you blog?
* Sourcing Photos
* Additional embeds besides YouTube, EA?
* Tell us about your brand
* Assign the Local lead these main pieces to be completed in 3 business days:

  * Marquee Content
  * Logo
  * Supplemental
  * Metadata

**Round 1 Build Out (2 business days)**Rising Campaigns will begin building site once the Local has completed the assignment for new content.

**Review 1:**

* RC will build the framework of the site using the vision direction and initial content provided in the assignment. We will show other content components with Lorem ipsum. 

**Round 1 Revisions + Rest of content (3 business days)**

* The Local will have the chance to review and submit a list of changes along with the rest of the content for the site now that they have seen the potential layout. 
* The Local also must provide DNS info with these revisions, if the DNS is with SEIU we will work with their IT department. 

**Round 2 Build Out (3 business days)**

* Rising Campaigns will take the suggestion and make updates as well as plug in the new content. 

**Review 2:**
This review over Zoom will show the Local a more completed project. The client will get to make minor tweaks after this review. 

**Round 2 Revisions (1 business day)\*\***\
Review 3:\*\*The Local will get their last chance to make small changes or decide if they want to pay for another round of significant changes. (Significant changes include major design overhaul or specific feature requests)

**Round 3 Build Out (1 business day)**Rising Campaigns will also set up the DNS to begin propagating site to go live.

**Final Review:** The Local will get to review the site and confirm it is good to go live. (If the client has changes in the final review that are not just content related, they will be billed hourly for those changes.)

**Go Live:** Same day of approval or next day depending on day. RC will push to the next Monday if the approval date lands on a Friday and will push to the next day if the approval comes after 3pm ET Monday-Thursday

**Website CMS Training** Rising Campaigns will set up a training with your team to do an in-depth dive into the backend of the site. Prior to the call we will send out backend access to edit content. These sessions will be recorded and the recording will be sent over the group after the meeting.

Here are a few tips in providing the best user experience for your audience:

1. Keep your file size small, if your file size above 4mb it's too big and will start to influence site load times for your users which could result in a high bounce rate. **Our recommended file size is 500k.**
2. For the best image resolution we suggest that images be **1800px x 1800px.**
3. Acceptable file types include: **jpg, jpeg, png, webp.**
4. Our system automatically resizes your image for screen resolution so you don't need to worry how the image will look on mobile vs desktop if you follow the above recommendations.

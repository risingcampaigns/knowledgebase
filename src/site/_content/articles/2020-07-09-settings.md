### Metadata

Metadata will help populate your links correctly with information that is relevant to the site. If a user shares your site url in a text or a social media post, metadata is what populates the content that is shown one you hit send or post.

How do I do it? Answer: In the Netlify CMS we have a tab dedicated to Metadata where you can enter in all your information.

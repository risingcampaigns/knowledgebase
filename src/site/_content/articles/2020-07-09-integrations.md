Here are all the current integrations we have and products we can work with and what information you will need to make forms work properly.

## **Fundraising**

* ### **ActBlue-**

  For the ActBlue donation piece we simply need you enter the URL of the ActionBlue form and then provide matching donation amounts. Here is a sample of the front end and what you see on the backend:

  ![](/img/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-17-at-1.52.35-pm.png)

  ![](/img/uploads/content_manager-3-.png)

  The user will be taken to the ActBlue for to complete their donation but the amount the user selected will be pre-populated. 
* ### NGPVAN/EveryAction

  For the NGPVAN/EveryAction donation piece we simply need you enter the URL of the NGPVAN/EveryAction form and then provide matching donation amounts. Here is a sample of the front end and what you see on the backend:

  ![](/img/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-17-at-1.52.35-pm.png)

  ![](/img/uploads/content_manager-2-.png)
* The user will be taken to the NGPVAN/EveryAction for to complete their donation but the amount the user selected will be pre-populated. Through this integration we can also turn on form pre-fill if your users are cookied into NGPVAN/EveryAction Fast Pass system. 

## Forms

* ### NGPVAN/EveryAction, The Action Network, MailChimp

  Form code can be grabbed from the form that your organization creates on your CRM. Once you have that code, simple place that code in the Body section of any page and your styled form will be created. Here is an example of form code that you would place in the body section of the CMS:

## Events

* ### Mobilize

  We don't have an active integration with Mobilize but we can use their iframe solution to link your Mobilize forms to you website allowing the user to stay on site rather than be redirected to a new URL. To do this we will your i-frame code from Mobilize and can plug that in the Body section just like we would an integrated embed code for the forms section.

## Mobile

* ### Mobile Commons

  We do not have a direct integration with Mobile Commons but can pull their embed code that is created on the Mobile Commons side and paste it into the body. In most cases this will work seamlessly with the style of your site, but in some cases we will need to help edit the code to overwrite any rules that come with code regarding styling of the form.

Here are all the current integrations we have and products we can work with, and what information you will need to make forms work properly.

## Fundraising

### ActBlue

  For the ActBlue donation piece, you simply need to enter the URL of the ActionBlue form and then provide matching donation amounts. Here is a sample of the front end and what you see on the backend:

  ![](/img/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-17-at-1.52.35-pm.png)

  ![](/img/uploads/content_manager-3-.png)

  The user will be taken to the ActBlue to complete their donation, but the amount the user selected will be pre-populated. 
  
### NGPVAN/EveryAction

For the NGPVAN/EveryAction donation piece, you simply need to enter the URL of the NGPVAN/EveryAction form and then provide matching donation amounts. Here is a sample of the front end and what you see on the backend:

![](/img/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-17-at-1.52.35-pm.png)

![](/img/uploads/content_manager-2-.png)

The user will be taken to the NGPVAN/EveryAction to complete their donation, but the amount the user selected will be pre-populated. The integration can be modified to pre-fill form fields if your users are cookied into NGPVAN/EveryAction Fast Pass system through this integration. 

## Forms

* ### NGPVAN/EveryAction, The Action Network, MailChimp

Form code can be grabbed from the form that your organization creates on your CRM. Once you have that code, place that code in the Body section of any page, and your styled form will be created. Here is an example of form code that you would place in the body section of the CMS:

## Events

### Mobilize

Mobilize does not currently offer a robust integration solution. But you can request and ifram link from Mobilize. The platform can use this iframe solution to display your Mobilize forms on the website. This allows the user to stay on-site rather than be redirected to a new URL. Once you have the iframe code from Mobilize, you can paste that into the Body section. 

## Mobile

### Mobile Commons

We do not have a direct integration with Mobile Commons but can pull their embed code created on the Mobile Commons side and paste it into the body. In most cases, this will work seamlessly with the style of your site. Occasionally, additional code may be necessary to overwrite any style rules that come with code.
